### 💡 What is this?

This is a **smart research assistant** powered by **AI**, built using a tool called **Streamlit** to create an easy-to-use web app.

---

### 🧠 What does it do?

1. **You type in a question** you want to research.
2. The AI:
   - Breaks your question into smaller parts,
   - **Searches the internet** for useful information,
   - **Summarizes what it finds**,
   - And then **writes a clear answer** for you.

---

### 🔌 What does it need to work?

- Some **API keys** (like passwords) for services it connects to:
  - 🔍 **Tavily** for online search,
  - 🤖 **OpenAI or Hugging Face** for AI-generated answers.
- These keys go into a file behind the scenes, called `.env`.

### 🖥️ How do you run it?

On a computer with Python installed, you run this command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```
